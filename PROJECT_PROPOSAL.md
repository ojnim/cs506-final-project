## Goal
There are several goals I want to achieve through this project

1. Language and Cognition
2. Gain experience with processing fMRI image data
3. causality analysis
4. representational similarity analysis
5. prediction model construction

## Dataset
The dataset that would be used in this project would be 

An fMRI dataset for investigating language control and cognitive control in bilinguals

The neural correlation between language control and cognitive control in bilinguals remains an area ripe for further exploration. In this work, we present a functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) dataset that simultaneously examines both types of control in 77 healthy, unrelated Chinese-English bilinguals. Each participant completed a language switching task to assess language control and a rule switching task to evaluate cognitive control while undergoing functional MRI scanning. We collected structural imaging data, task-related functional imaging data, and behavioral data from the participants. Additionally, their language proficiency and domain-general cognitive ability were recorded after the scanning. This dataset was released early to facilitate the exploration of the neural relationship between language control and cognitive control, promoting its broader use and benefiting the scientific community. It is well-suited for the study of causality analysis, representational similarity analysis and the prediction model construction.
