# Title

Language and Cognition

## Description

This project is 

## Goal
There are several goals I want to achieve through this project

1. Language and Cognition
2. Gain experience with processing fMRI image data
3. causality analysis
4. representational similarity analysis
5. prediction model construction

## Dataset
The dataset that would be used in this project would be "An fMRI dataset for investigating language control and cognitive control in bilinguals" https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds005455/tree/main

This dataset is consisted of 77 Chinese-English bilingual's fMRI experiment result and participants data. Each participant completed two tasks during the experiment : language switching task to assess language control and rule switching task to evaluate cognitive control. 

1. structual imaging data

2. task-related functional imaging data

3. behavioral data from the participants


## Modeling Method and Visualization
As least 1 at most 3.
