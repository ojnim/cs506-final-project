# Language and Cognition : the neural relationship

## Description

This project aims to understand the relationship between language and cognition in the perspective of neuroscience. functional MRI data shows brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow in different areas of the brain.

This project would 
language level and how language switch is affecting cognitive 


## Goal
There are several goals I want to achieve through this project

1. In Language Control task, 
2. In Cognitive Control task,
3. Understand how Language and Cognitive activity works together for the tasks that require both
4. Gain experience with processing fMRI image data

prediction model construction
4. representational similarity analysis

## Dataset
The dataset that would be used in this project would be "An fMRI dataset for investigating language control and cognitive control in bilinguals" https://github.com/OpenNeuroDatasets/ds005455/tree/main

This dataset is consisted of 77 Chinese-English bilingual's fMRI experiment result and participants data. Each participant completed two tasks during the experiment : language switching task to assess language control and rule switching task to evaluate cognitive control. 

This repository ( https://github.com/GttNeuro/Guo-Lab_datapaper ) contains information about the language control task and cognitive control task.

Language Control : 'naming in L1'

Cognitive Control : 'pressing the same direction'


1. structual imaging data

2. task-related functional imaging data

3. behavioral data from the participants - participant responses and performance metrics


## Modeling Method and Visualization
As least 1 at most 3.

## Test Plan

## To-Do
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Cleaning
